## Introduction

Chainlink's official Web3 services, powered by Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs), are the gold standard for secure, trust-minimized off-chain computation. 

But did you know there are alternative Chainlink oracle solutions that can offer unique benefits for your Web3 app? 

:::info
 Chainlink's native services (ie, Chainlink Functions) are supported by trust-minimized DONs, and are the best choice if you’re aiming to maximize decentralization. Developers whose applications need to prioritize trust-minimization above all else should consider using these first.
:::

At LinkWell Nodes, we offer several bespoke Chainlink oracle services that optimize for:

- Flexible payment models and rapid deployment
- Deep customization options
- Scalable, reliable infrastructure

Our services can be particularly useful for dApps that require specific customizations, have unique integration needs, or are looking for more flexible pricing options.

In this article, we'll explore:

- 4 custom Chainlink oracle services offered by LinkWell Nodes
- The unique benefits and use cases for each service
- How to get started integrating these services into your dApp

Let's dive in and discover how these alternative oracle solutions can enhance your Web3 app!

1. ## On-Demand Requests (”Any API”) to Our Chainlink Oracles

[On-Demand Requests](https://docs.linkwellnodes.io/knowledgebase/Direct-Request-Guide) (previously known as direct requests, or “Any API”) allow your dApp to request off-chain data directly from our Chainlink oracles. With support for any external API, you can integrate a wide range of real-world data sources into your application via a simple smart contract call that results in an HTTP request from our servers.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/Chainlink-Oracle-Services-By-LinkWell-Nodes/Chainlink_Oracle_DR.webp" alt="Chainlink oracle basic request model" />
</p>

Use on-demand requests to:

1. Incorporate weather data, financial market prices, sports scores, and more into your smart contracts.
2. Retrieve off-chain data based on real-world events, such as insurance claim payouts.
3. Enhance your blockchain-based app with near real-time, up-to-date, real-world information.

**Example:** Consider a Web3 supply chain management dApp that uses on-demand requests to our Chainlink oracles for tracking the location and status of shipments. By integrating with IoT devices and shipping APIs, the dApp can provide near real-time updates on the progress of deliveries. This enables all parties in the supply chain to have a transparent and up-to-date view of the shipment status, improving efficiency and trust in the process. For additional examples, please see our [documentation](https://docs.linkwellnodes.io/services/direct-request-jobs/Any-API-Guide)

**When to Use On-Demand Requests?**

- Your Web3 application needs to make requests for data based on an external trigger or user interaction.
- You require low-latency, on-demand updates for off-chain data from an API.

## 2. VRN: Verifiable Randomness for Gaming and DeFi

Verifiable Random Number Generation (VRN) provides a trustless and tamper-proof source of randomness for your Web3 dApp, ensuring fairness and transparency in applications that rely on random numbers within your smart contracts.

With VRN, you can:

1. Generate multiple random numbers at once that are verifiable on-chain or off-chain.
2. Ensure fairness and transparency in randomized ecosystems, such as with gaming and lotteries
3. Build trust with users by demonstrating the verifiable integrity of your dApp

**Example:** Consider a decentralized lottery platform that uses VRN to select winners. By leveraging LinkWell Nodes’s VRN, the lottery can generate provably random numbers on-chain, ensuring that the selection process is fair and unbiased. Users can verify the randomness of the lottery results, fostering trust in the platform. This level of transparency and fairness is crucial for attracting users and building a successful lottery dApp.

**When to Use VRN?**

- Your dApp requires a secure and verifiable source of randomness for critical functions, such as determining winners in games or lotteries.
- You want to provide users with the ability to independently verify the integrity of the random number generation process.
- You want a more customizable, gas-efficient, verifiable random number solution than [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf)

## 3. Flux Monitor DONs

[Flux Monitor DONs](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-jobs#flux-monitor-jobs) use the [decentralized data model](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model) to provide secure, reliable, and trust-minimized price feeds for Web3 applications, particularly within the DeFi space. By leveraging the Flux Aggregator protocol, our DONs ensure accurate and tamper-resistant price data, enabling your dApp to operate with high integrity.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/Chainlink-Oracle-Services-By-LinkWell-Nodes/Flux_Aggregator_Dark.webp" alt="Chainlink oracle Flux Monitor DON" />
</p>

Integrate Flux Monitor DONs to:

1. Obtain trust-minimized price feeds, written to an on-chain aggregation contract, for various assets or price pairs.
2. Receive push-based updates on a heartbeat timer, or when the price crosses a certain threshold.

**Example:** A decentralized lending platform can use Flux Monitor DONs to access tamper-proof price feeds for the assets it supports. By receiving price updates on a regular heartbeat timer or when the price deviates beyond a specified threshold, the platform ensures it always has the most up-to-date and reliable price data, mitigating risks such as undercollateralized loans or delayed liquidations.

**When to Use?**

- Your dApp requires decentralized (more than one oracle), tamper-resistant price data for critical financial operations, such as lending, borrowing, or trading.
- You require price updates on price pairs or blockchain networks not currently supported by Chainlink, or customized on-chain updates.

## 4. Chainlink Price Feeds: Cost-Effective Price Updates

Our custom [Chainlink oracle price feed solution](https://docs.linkwellnodes.io/blog/Custom-Chainlink-Price-Feed-Solution) offers regular price updates at predefined intervals and/or deviation-based thresholds, providing a cost-effective solution for Web3 dApps that require near real-time price data. These price feeds are highly customizable, and are designed to strike a balance between data freshness and on-chain transaction costs, making them a gas-efficient (and thus cost-efficient) solution for smart contract applications that need pricing data delivered on a constant basis.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/Chainlink-Oracle-Services-By-LinkWell-Nodes/CL_Cron_Price_Feed.webp" alt="Chainlink oracle price feed" />
</p>

Use LinkWell Nodes’s Price Feeds to:

1. Obtain on-chain price feed data, written directly to your smart contract across various assets or price pairs.
2. Receive push-based updates to your contract on a heartbeat timer, and/or whenever the real-world price changes by a certain threshold % (customizable).

**Example:** Consider a prediction market dApp that allows users to bet on the outcome of future events, such as elections or sports matches. The dApp may only need to settle bets and distribute rewards at specific times, such as at the end of each day or when the event concludes. In this case, using Chainlink Price Feeds to retrieve the relevant price data at the settlement time would be more cost-effective than using real-time price updates. The dApp can access reliable price data at the predefined intervals, ensuring accurate settlement of bets while minimizing on-chain transaction costs.

**When to Use?**

- Your Web3 dApp requires near real-time price updates delivered automatically to your smart contracts on a regular basis (and/or whenever a certain pre-condition is met).
- You want to optimize on-chain transaction costs while still maintaining reliable and accurate price data for your application.
- Your dApp can accept the level of risk associated with price updates from a single Chainlink node operator (read more in our [Service-Level Agreement (SLA)](https://docs.linkwellnodes.io/services/direct-request-jobs/Service-Level-Agreement)).
