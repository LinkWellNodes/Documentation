## Introduction

In the dynamic world of Web3 and blockchain technology, randomness isn't just a game of chance - it's a cornerstone for fairness, security, and trust. 

Whether you're running a decentralized game, a lottery, or any application where unpredictability is key, the quality of your random number generator can make or break user trust.

At LinkWell Nodes, we understand the critical role that verifiable randomness plays in the decentralized ecosystem. That's why we're excited to introduce our new Verifiable Random Numbers (VRN) service. Built to mirror several aspects of [Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF)](https://docs.chain.link/vrf), our VRN service offers an inexpensive, easy-to-use, and production-ready API for bringing true randomness to your projects.

In this article, we'll delve into why verifiable randomness matters, how our VRN solution works, the benefits it brings to your Web3 applications, and how you can get started today.

### Looking to request verifiable random numbers (VRNs)? 

Visit our [data feed documentation](https://docs.linkwellnodes.io/services/direct-request-jobs/mainnets), and select your desired network (ie, "Arbitrum mainnet") and data type (ie, "Verifiable random numbers (VRN / RNG)").

> _**Disclaimer**: While our VRN solution shares many capabilities with Chainlink's VRF service, it does have some limitations. Therefore, we recommend using Chainlink's VRF service if trust minimization is crucial for your Web3 application. However, if trust minimization is not a priority, or if you require a random number oracle solution on an EVM-compatible chain not supported by Chainlink, we are here and ready to assist you!_

## The Challenge of Achieving Verifiable Randomness in Blockchains

For a sequence to be considered verifiably random, it needs to exhibit several key characteristics:

* Unpredictability: The outcome cannot be known or predicted before it occurs.
* Fairness: Each possible outcome has an equal chance of happening.
* Verifiability: The randomness can be independently verified by anyone.
* Security: The process is resistant to manipulation or interference.
* Uniqueness: The sequence cannot be reproduced unless the exact original conditions are replicated.

Computers, by their very nature, struggle with these criteria. They operate on deterministic principles, meaning they follow specific algorithms and produce the same output given the same input. This makes it challenging to generate random numbers that are verifiably unpredictable and unbiased.

## Why Randomness Matters in Blockchain

Randomness is vital for various applications within the blockchain ecosystem:

* **Decentralized Gaming:** Ensuring that in-game events, loot drops, or character attributes are determined fairly and unpredictably enhances player trust and engagement.

* **Lotteries and Raffles:** Providing transparent and unbiased selection processes boosts confidence among participants.

* **NFT Minting:** Assigning random attributes or rarity levels to NFTs maintains scarcity and value within collections.

* **Governance Models:** Randomly selecting validators, committee members, or proposal reviewers prevents collusion and promotes fairness.

* **Security Protocols:** Generating cryptographic keys, nonces, or salts for secure communications and operations within dApps.

## The Role of Chainlink Oracles

Chainlink oracles bridge the gap between off-chain data and on-chain smart contracts, securely enabling blockchains to interact with real-world data. 

Chainlink’s official Verifiable Random Function (VRF) service, supported by the decentralized Chainlink Oracle Networks (DON), sets a high standard for on-chain randomness by providing cryptographically-secure, verifiable random values. The decentralized nature of the DON also ensures high reliability and security, making Chainlink VRF the ideal choice when verifiable randomness is needed.

However, some use cases require custom solutions to address certain limitations, such as a blockchain network that isn't currently supported, or a custom configuration. 

Our custom Chainlink oracle solutions meet these specialized demands by offering tailored randomness solutions on virtually any Chainlink supported blockchain, flexible payment models, and more. This approach expands the scope of what’s possible with Chainlink’s technology while maintaining its signature security and reliability. 

In summary, Chainlink VRF is optimal for most applications needing randomness with a high degree of security, but custom oracle solutions like ours provide versatility for specialized needs, ensuring that unique project requirements are met effectively.

## Introducing VRN: A Custom Chainlink Oracle Service By LinkWell Nodes

### What is VRN?

Our Verifiable Random Number (VRN) service is an innovative addition to our Chainlink oracle offerings. It provides a secure, efficient, and easy-to-integrate source of verifiable randomness for your decentralized applications.

### How VRN Works

LinkWell Nodes' Verifiable Random Numbers (VRN) service provides secure, transparent, and verifiable random numbers for blockchain applications. Here’s how it works:

- **Random Seed Generation**: A new secure random seed is generated every 6-hour epoch. This seed is hashed and stored on our secure SOC-2 compliance infrastructure, to prevent manipulation, becoming publicly available only after the epoch ends.

- **Request and Delivery**: When a smart contract calls the service, it specifies a range (`minVal` and `maxVal`) as well as a `quantity` (N). The oracle generates N random number within this range using the current epoch's seed. It returns the number along with the seed’s hash.

- **Verification**: Once the epoch ends and the seed is revealed, users can independently verify the randomness of the number, ensuring fairness and transparency.
