Welcome to our blog!

As community based Chainlink node operators with a combined several years of experience supporting aspiring Chainlink node operators and Web3 developers, we've seen a lot of the same questions arise over the years.  Questions such as "Should I run my own node or use an existing node operators services?", "Is running a Chainlink node worth it or profitable?", "How do I find a node operator for a custom data feed that I need?", and so much more. Admittedly, these questions aren't always the easiest to find answers to, nor are many of them answered within Chainlink's vast community resources and online documentation. Our [FAQ](https://docs.linkwellnodes.io/knowledgebase/FAQ) and this blog, however, are an attempt at answering these questions.

In this blog, we will be writing about a number of topics that we believe both aspiring Chainlink node operators and Chainlink users (Web3 based developers, projects, or teams) alike could greatly benefit from. At a high level, the topics for Chainlink node operators will be based around our hard-earned wisdom from deploying Chainlink nodes over the last few years, coupled with our in-depth expertise across several industries to include cloud, monitoring, security, development, and more.  

This includes topics such as deploying Chainlink nodes along with the surrounding infrastructure such as full nodes, external adapters, and databases. We also aim to cover a variety of other relatively unspoken topics about Chainlink node profitability, who should run a node and why, node maintenance, security, monitoring, and much more.

As sanctioned Chainlink developer experts, we also aim to support Chainlink users and Web3 developers with as much useful and actionable content as we possibly can.  We've already started to do so via our [Direct Request Guide](https://docs.linkwellnodes.io/services/direct-request-jobs/Jobs-and-Pricing) and our [Any API Examples](https://docs.linkwellnodes.io/knowledgebase/Any-API-Guide), but we don't plan to stop there. Future blogs will likely include topics covering all of Chainlink's services such as CCIP, VRF, Functions, Automation, Data Feeds, and of course, Any API. 

We are excited to share our knowledge and expertise with anyone and everyone who interacts with Chainlink nodes in one form another, and we hope you - the reader, find value from this blog.  If you do, we'd appreciate a share on social media! Feel free as well to hop into our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Xs6SjqVPUA) if you'd like to learn more on a given topic, or just pop in to say hi!

Thanks. And happy reading!
