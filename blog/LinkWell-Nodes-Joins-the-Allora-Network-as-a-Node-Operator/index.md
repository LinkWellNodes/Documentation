## Announcement

LinkWell Nodes has joined the group of validators that help secure the Allora Network. As a U.S.-based Web3 infrastructure company, LinkWell Nodes specializes in delivering Chainlink oracle data feeds and secure blockchain node deployments. Holding true to its core tenet of being a Web3 global citizen, LinkWell Nodes powers 95% of its infrastructure using renewable energy, and will reach 100% by next year. LinkWell Nodes operates server infrastructure across several physically-distinct cloud data centers, with its primary center-of-operations located in the northwestern United States. Using infrastructure-as-code (IaC), LinkWell Nodes is able to ensure robust scalability, disaster recovery, and 24/7 monitoring across all of its highly-available blockchain infrastructure.

With an extensive track record operating custom Chainlink data feeds on 14 blockchains (at the time of this writing), LinkWell Nodes is uniquely positioned to help the Allora Network establish a strong foundation by deploying itself as a node operator in the early days of the network.

> *"At LinkWell Nodes, we're cognizant of the artificial intelligence movement and the opportunity it represents for transforming societal progress and outcomes,"* says LinkWell Nodes co-founder [Ken Reiners](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-reiners-755806167/). *"However as a Web3 company, we also recognize the importance of ensuring that access to such tools stays in the hands of the many, and that their evolution, growth, and ownership remains decentralized and transparent. To us, the Allora Network represents the consummation of these two ideals. Together with our extensive experience running reliable blockchain node infrastructure, joining the Allora Network as a validator was a no-brainer for us."*

## Evolution of the Allora Network and LinkWell Nodes

AI is the most deflationary, expressive form of computation to ever exist, and can intelligently process large amounts of information. For the past 3 years, Allora Labs (formerly known as Upshot) has been building AI-powered crypto infrastructure to power new applications and protocols in gaming, lending, market making, and more. Models built by the Allora Labs team have effectively produced price predictions for more than 400 million assets with a 95-99% confidence for the most accurate predictions.

The team's earlier work in subjective consensus mechanism design, along with learnings gathered from building AI-powered crypto infrastructure, led them to create the Allora Network, a self-improving decentralized AI network that harnesses both the efficiency of AI and the wisdom of the collective to reach one mission: transform intelligence itself into a digital commodity.

As an Allora node operator, LinkWell Nodes furthers that mission by operating both a validator to secure the Allora chain and a Reputer to rate the performance of the ML models delivered by Allora Workers, performing a critical service that reinforces the self-improvement mechanism of Allora.

> *"Collaborating with veteran secure systems builders like LinkWell Nodes is crucial to the success of Allora,"* says [Nick Emmons](https://twitter.com/nick_emmons), Co-Founder of Allora Labs. *"Ken and his team's dedication to secure blockchain infrastructure directly contributes to the growth and security of the network."*

## Why LinkWell Nodes Chose the Allora Network

As a company at the forefront of web3 infrastructure development, LinkWell Nodes seeks to support the growth of cutting-edge protocols that drive net-new use cases. In pursuit of this goal, the company sought a versatile solution that would allow it to focus on creating innovative infrastructure tools.

After a comprehensive review of available networks, LinkWell Nodes chose to integrate with Allora due to the network's unique benefits:

* **Collective Intelligence**: Models in Allora's network continuously learn from each other, enhancing its collective intelligence and enabling it to self-improve over time.

* **Context-Awareness**: Network participants forecast each other's performance under the current conditions, thereby creating a form of context-awareness that enables the network to achieve the best inferences under any circumstances.

* **Tamper-Proof Outputs**: Allora utilizes [zkML](https://www.alloralabs.xyz/) and cryptographic verification to create outputs that are verifiably secure and unalterable, ensuring trust in AI's decisions.

* **Universal Access**: Allora offers permissionless, composable access to AI, enabling builders everywhere to innovate and create with AI as a foundational element.

* **Balanced Outcomes**: Allora leverages diverse data inputs to reduce bias, leading to more balanced and fair AI-driven outcomes.
