## Smart Contract Development

### Consumer contracts

For any customers looking to utilize our infrastructure for custom data, we offer free smart contract development services (with some exceptions). To get you started, we'll provide you with a custom **consumer contract** (smart contract) that receives your required data. 

Please feel free to reach out to us via our [request survey](https://linkwellnodes.io/Getting-Started.html) with the specific details of your request.

### Miscellaneous development

We offer simple custom smart contract development services for any request NOT related to using our infrastructure, for a fee.

Please feel free to [email us](https://linkwellnodes.io/Home.html#contact-us "Contact LinkWell Nodes") with the relevant details of your request.

## External Adapters (EAs)

### Free external adapter hosting and development

* We'll host your external adapter for free on our highly redundant infrastructure - all you'll pay is the typical per-transaction cost in LINK.
* If you need a custom adapter developed, we've got you covered, and can typically do this for free within 1-2 business days.

### External adapter use cases

You might need an external adapter if any of the following requirements pertain to you:

* You need private, low latency, and/or high throughput off-chain computation to save gas.
* You need to write data to other blockchains (interoperability).

You can read Chainlink's official documentation on external adapters [here](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters).
