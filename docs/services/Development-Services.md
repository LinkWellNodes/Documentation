## Smart Contract Development

### Chainlink contracts

For anyone seeking help using our mainnet infrastructure, we offer free smart contract development services (with some exceptions for complex use cases), and will provide you with a customized smart contract that retrieves your required data. 

To get started, please fill out our [request survey](https://linkwellnodes.io/Getting-Started.html) with the specific details of your request.

### Miscellaneous development

We offer simple custom smart contract development services for any testnet-only projects, or requests unrelated to our infrastructure, for a development fee of **150 USD / hour** (minimum one hour, payment through cryptocurrency preferred).

Please feel free to [contact us](https://linkwellnodes.io/#contact-us "Contact LinkWell Nodes") with the relevant details of your request.

## External Adapter (EA) Support

### Free external adapter hosting and development

* We'll host your external adapter for free on our highly redundant infrastructure - all you'll pay is the typical per-transaction cost in LINK.
* If you need a custom adapter developed, we've got you covered, and can typically do this for free within **1-2 business days**.

### External adapter use cases

You might need an external adapter if any of the following requirements pertain to you:

* You need private, low latency, and/or high throughput off-chain computation to save gas.
* You need to write data to other blockchains (interoperability).

You can read Chainlink's official documentation on external adapters [here](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters).
