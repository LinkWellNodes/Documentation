# External Adapters (EAs)

### Free external adapter hosting and development

* We'll host your external adapter for free on our highly redundant infrastructure - all you'll pay is the typical per-transaction cost in LINK.
* If you need a custom adapter developed, we've got you covered, and can typically do this for free within 1-2 business days.

### External adapter use cases

You might need an external adapter if any of the following requirements pertain to you:

* You need private, low latency, and/or high throughput off-chain computation to save gas.
* You need to write data to other blockchains (interoperability).

You can read Chainlink's official documentation on external adapters [here](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters).
