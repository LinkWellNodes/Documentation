# Mainnet Data Feeds

Using the Chainlink **direct request** model, we allow you to retrieve any custom, real-world data from any internet-based API ('any API'), and write it to your blockchain smart contract. Our highly-redundant Chainlink oracle infrastructure ensures that your data is delivered safely, securely, and reliably every time.
