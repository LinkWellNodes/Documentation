# Oracle Request Examples 
Chainlink's [Any API](https://docs.chain.link/any-api/introduction) request model is a versatile feature that allows smart contracts to request data from off-chain sources. At LinkWell Nodes, we strive to make it as easy as possible for Web3 developers to leverage and utilize Chainlink to make such requests. 

The below examples will walk you through the process of using our Chainlink oracles to request data from various example API providers.
