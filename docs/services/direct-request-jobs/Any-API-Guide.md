# Real-World Examples of Chainlink Oracle Requests
Chainlink's [Any API](https://docs.chain.link/any-api/introduction) functionality (powered by their [basic request model](/blog/Chainlink-Direct-Requests-Guide) - previously known as their [direct request model](/blog/Chainlink-Direct-Requests-Guide)) is a versatile feature that allows smart contracts to request data from off-chain sources. At LinkWell Nodes, we strive to make it as easy as possible for Web3 and dApp developers to leverage and utilize Chainlink to make such requests. 

The below examples will walk you through the process of using our Chainlink oracles to request data from various example API providers.
