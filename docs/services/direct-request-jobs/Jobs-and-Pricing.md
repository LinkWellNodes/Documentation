# Chainlink Data Feeds

Our Chainlink data feeds utilize Chainlink's **direct request** model, allowing you to write real-world data from anywhere on the internet ('any API') to your blockchain smart contract. Our highly-redundant oracle infrastructure ensures that your data is delivered safely, securely, and reliably every time. 

Please use the links below to view our documentation on how to initiate a request from your smart contract. If you run into any trouble, head on over to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AJ66pRz4) for the fastest service.
