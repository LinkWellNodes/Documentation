# Custom Data Feeds

Using the Chainlink **direct request** model, we allow you to retrieve any custom, real-world data from any internet-based API ('any API'), and write it to your blockchain smart contract. Our highly-redundant Chainlink oracle infrastructure ensures that your data is delivered safely, securely, and reliably every time. 

Please use the links below to view our documentation on how to initiate a request. If you run into any trouble, we are here to help! Head on over to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AJ66pRz4) for the fastest service.

## External Adapters

### Full-service external adapter hosting and development:

* We'll host your external adapter (EA) for free on our highly redundant infrastructure - all you'll pay is the typical per-transaction cost in LINK.
* If you need a custom adapter developed, we've got you covered, and can typically do this for free within 1-2 business days.

### Situations in which you might need an external adapter:
* Private, low latency, and/or high throughput off-chain computation to save gas.
* Writing data to other blockchains (interoperability).

You can learn more about external adapters [here](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters), and find the list of Chainlink-provided external adapters [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/external-adapters-js/tree/main/packages/sources).
