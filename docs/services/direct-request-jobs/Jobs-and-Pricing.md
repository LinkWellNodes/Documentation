Our Chainlink data feeds utilize Chainlink's **direct request** model, allowing you to write customized real-world data from anywhere on the internet to your blockchain smart contract or Web3 dApp. They are backed by our highly-redundant, SOC 2-compliant infrastructure, which is housed in multiple distinct datacenters. Simply trigger your smart contract's `request()` function, and our oracle infrastructure will ensure that your data is delivered safely, securely, and on-time. 

Please use the links below to build your first Chainlink request.

### How it works:

Requesting internet-based data for your smart contract or Web3 dApp involves 3 basic steps:

1. Use the code samples provided within our documentation to build your smart contract.
2. If deploying to mainnet, please fill out our [request form](https://linkwellnodes.io/Getting-Started.html) to receive our mainnet oracle address.
3. Execute your contract's `request()` function. Our oracle will make a secure request to your designated API, parse the result, and write the corresponding data to the `fulfill()` function of your smart contract within seconds.

:::tip
