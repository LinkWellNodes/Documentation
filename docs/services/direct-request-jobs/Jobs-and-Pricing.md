# Chainlink Data Feeds

<h2 class='lw-subtitle'><lw-emphasis>Write real-world data to your blockchain smart contract</lw-emphasis> from any API on the internet using our 
highly-redundant Chainlink oracle infrastructure.</h2>

[![Custom Chainlink data feeds by LinkWell Nodes](/img/lw-banner_1080x485_Docs-DataFeeds-white.webp "Custom Chainlink data feeds by LinkWell Nodes")](/services/direct-request-jobs/mainnets/)

We offer three types of Chainlink oracle data feeds to write data to your blockchain smart contract:

| Data Feed Type | Description | Trigger Method | Documentation |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| [Price Feeds](#1-price-feeds) | Automated data delivery at set intervals and/or deviation thresholds. | Automatic updates | [Request Form](https://linkwellnodes.io/Getting-Started.html) |
| [Direct Request Jobs](#2-direct-request-jobs) | On-demand data delivery from any API endpoint. | Manual trigger via contract call | [Mainnet Jobs](/services/direct-request-jobs/mainnets/)<br/>[Testnet Jobs](/services/direct-request-jobs/testnets/) |
| [Random Numbers (VRN)](#3-verifiable-random-numbers-vrn) | Cryptographically secure random number generation. | Manual trigger via contract call | [Mainnet Jobs](/services/direct-request-jobs/mainnets/)<br/>[Testnet Jobs](/services/direct-request-jobs/testnets/) |

Our feeds support all standard blockchain data types:
* `uint256` and `uint256[]` (unsigned integers)
* `int256` and `int256[]` (signed integers)
* `bool` and `bool[]` (boolean values)
* `string` / `bytes` and `string[]` / `bytes[]` (text data)

### Looking for a custom price feed? 
We can update any of your contract's data at a set frequency, and/or deviation-based trigger condition. [**Fill out our request survey**](https://linkwellnodes.io/Getting-Started.html) to get this set up - we'll typically deliver your new feed to you in **24 hours or less!**

- Data from anywhere on the internet (prices, RWAs, sports bets, weather, etc.)
- Custom API integrations
- One-time or occasional data needs
- Pay-per-request model
