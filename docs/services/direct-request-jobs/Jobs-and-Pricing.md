# Chainlink Data Feeds

Our Chainlink data feeds utilize Chainlink's **direct request** model, allowing you to write customized real-world data from anywhere on the internet ('Any API') to your blockchain smart contract or Web3 dApp. Our highly-redundant oracle infrastructure ensures that your data is delivered safely, securely, and reliably every time. 

Please use the links below to learn how to build your first Chainlink request. If you run into any trouble, we recommend joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Xs6SjqVPUA) for help.

* [Testnets](/services/direct-request-jobs/testnets/)

### How it works:

The process for integrating a custom data feed into your smart contract or Web3 dApp is simple:

1. Use our documentation (links above) to build your contract.
2. If deploying to mainnet, please fill out our [request form](https://linkwellnodes.io/Getting-Started.html) to receive our mainnet oracle address.
3. Execute your contract's `request` function! Our oracle will write your data to your smart contract within seconds.
