# Chainlink Data Feeds

Our Chainlink data feeds utilize Chainlink's **direct request** model, and allow you to write real-world data from anywhere on the internet ('any API') to your blockchain smart contract. Our highly-redundant oracle infrastructure ensures that your data is delivered safely, securely, and reliably every time. 

Please use the links below to view our documentation on how to initiate a request from your smart contract. If you run into any trouble, we are here to help! Head on over to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AJ66pRz4) for the fastest service.

* [Testnets](/services/direct-request-jobs/testnets/)

## Service-Level Agreement (SLA)

### Mainnet Uptime

* We guarantee the uptime of all of our mainnet data feeds to be greater than or equal to **99.99%**, as averaged throughout the calendar year.

### Testnet Uptime

* To reduce costs for our customers, our testnet data feeds may experience occassional interruptions as we roll out periodic updates and continuously improve our services. These updates should last fewer than **5 minutes**, and occur no more than once per day. If you are experiencing an unexpected issue in our testnet data feeds that exceeds this timeframe, please reach out to us via our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AJ66pRz4).

### Data protection

* All data at rest is protected with **256-bit** encryption (or better)
* All data that leaves our internal network is **end-to-end encrypted**, including all in-transit data
* All infrastructure access points are secured by **2-factor authentication** (or better)

## External Adapters (EAs)

### Free external adapter hosting and development

* We'll host your external adapter for free on our highly redundant infrastructure - all you'll pay is the typical per-transaction cost in LINK.
* If you need a custom adapter developed, we've got you covered, and can typically do this for free within 1-2 business days.

### External adapter use cases

You might need an external adapter if any of the following requirements pertain to you:

* You need private, low latency, and/or high throughput off-chain computation to save gas.
* You need to write data to other blockchains (interoperability).

You can read Chainlink's official documentation on external adapters [here](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters).
