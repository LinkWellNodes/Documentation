### Looking for a custom price feed? 
We can update any of your contract's data at a set frequency, and/or deviation-based trigger condition. [**Fill out our request survey**](https://linkwellnodes.io/Getting-Started.html) to get this set up - we'll typically deliver your new feed to you in **24 hours or less!**

### Enterprise-grade oracle infrastructure

All of our Chainlink oracles are backed by a redundant, SOC 2-compliant infrastructure, which is distributed across multiple physically-distinct datacenters. Simply trigger your smart contract's `request()` function, and our oracle infrastructure will ensure that your data is delivered safely, securely, and on-time. 

Read more about our data feeds guarantees in our [Service-Level Agreement (SLA)](/services/direct-request-jobs/Service-Level-Agreement).

:::tip
We offer free smart contract development services for our **mainnet customers**. If interested, please reach out to us via our [request form](https://linkwellnodes.io/Getting-Started.html), or [book a meeting](https://calendly.com/linkwell-nodes) with us to get started.
