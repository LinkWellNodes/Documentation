## Troubleshooting
* Please ensure you are pre-funding the correct and appropriate amount of LINK tokens into your contracts before making the request. 
* Double check that you are using the correct address and job ID for the job you are targeting via our job listings above.
* Confirm that the API endpoint you are making the HTTP request to is working via curl.  Each job includes a sample curl command.
* If your API Endpoint requires authentication via an API key, please [reach out](https://linkwellnodes.io/Home.html#contact-us "Contact LinkWell Nodes") to us so that we can securely store and utilize your key via an [external adapter](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/external-adapters-js/tree/main/packages/sources).
