PROS:
eliminate GET/POST/PUT/DELETE dimensions
eliminate multiply / no-multiply jobs
eliminate JSON parse / non-JSON jobs
	> currently, if user doesn't want to parse a JSON, and just wants the entire naked result, a different job needs to be created, or else the job scheduler will complain
eliminate need for EA for passing headers
eliminate need for EA for storing API keys
centralized logging -> centralized monitoring and alerting in a consistent log format (ie, good for Splunk) 
customer whitelisting is possible (ie, allow only certain customers)
custom error handling is possible
allow for multiplication of all elements within a uint256[] result (multipliers not supported for numeric arrays otherwise) 


CONS:
untested (connection limits, load, etc.?)
	counterpoint: can develop a custom healthchecker so that ALB routes requests appropriately
consumers use more gas for request txn (more params)
	counterpoint: can develop an optional job where consumers can instead include all params in ONE param (via JSON)
