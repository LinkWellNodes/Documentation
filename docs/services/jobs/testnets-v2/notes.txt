PROS:
eliminate GET/POST/PUT/DELETE dimensions
eliminate the brittle JSON parser 
	> currently, if user doesn't want to parse a JSON, and just wants the entire naked result, a different job needs to be created, or else the job scheduler will complain
	> currently, if the API endpoint returns a different format, the CL job will fail entirely, and the user won't get any error code 
eliminate need for EA for passing headers
eliminate need for EA for storing API keys
centralized logging -> centralized monitoring and alerting in a consistent log format (ie, good for Splunk) 
customer whitelisting is possible (ie, allow only certain customers)
custom error handling is possible 


CONS:
untested (connection limits, load, etc.?)
	counterpoint: can develop a custom healthchecker so that ALB routes requests appropriately
consumers use more gas for request txn (more params)
	counterpoint: can develop an optional job where consumers can instead include all params in ONE param (via JSON)
