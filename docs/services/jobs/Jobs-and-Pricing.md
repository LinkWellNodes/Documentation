## External Adapters

#### Full-service external adapter hosting and development:

* We'll host your external adapter (EA) for free on our highly redundant infrastructure - all you'll pay is the typical per-transaction cost in LINK!
* If you need a custom adapter developed, we've got you covered, and can do this for free within 1-2 business days.

#### Situations in which you might need an external adapter:
* API Authentication (keep private API password keys private via our securely hosted infrastructure).
* Private, low latency, and/or high throughput off-chain computation to save gas.
* Writing data to other blockchains (interoperability).

You can learn more about external adapters [here](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters), and find the list of Chainlink-provided external adapters [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/external-adapters-js/tree/main/packages/sources).
