The process for integrating a custom Chainlink data feed is simple:

1. Use our self-service documentation to build your contract (link above).
2. If needed, we'll build your custom data feed and test it on testnet for free.
3. You'll receive all necessary smart contract request logic to integrate your data feed into your Web3 dApp.
